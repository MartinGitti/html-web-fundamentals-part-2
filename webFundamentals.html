		<h4><b>What to consider when adding images to your web page:</b></h4>
		<p>Remember that when images are added to a web page that all users use different devices to view the web page.
			Keep
			in mind that all devices have different screen sizes, resolutions etc.
			A developer should always consider using responsive image codes that work a lot better and allows the most
			effective way for users to view the images on different devices without altering the image too much.

		<header><u><b>Questions and Answers of task:</b></u></header>
		<br>
		<h4>1. What is Web 3.0 and how is it different from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0? </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>From my own understanding, web 3.0 is the new age internet that is way more advanced from the first
				static
				web pages that existed.
			<li>It has evolved to be far more exciting, apealing and allows users to interact in multiple ways using
				various
				avenues. Allows users to have acces to so many different web pages all at once.</li>
			<li>It has become so interactive with users that it appears to be more human-like than just something
				controlled
				by humans with automatic replies and responces to the users actions.</li>
			<li>It is faster and more convenient for users to use and to go from one web page to another via links like
				hash
				tags and thousands of different portals.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h5><em>How Web 3.0 is different from web 2.0 and web 1.0:</em></h5>
		<ul>
			<li>The web 1.0 only allowed users to view information.
				(Extremely limited)</li>
			<li>Web 2.0 allowed users to interact with the web page in the form of adding information to it such as
				personal
				details, comments etc.</li>
			<li>Web 3.0 allows users to do so much more, to have all information stored accross multiple devises, to
				make
				changes that reflect instantaneosly on all devises once synced with one another.
				Web pages are more personalised for users according to information gathered from all the users
				information
				that's stored. It is a massive web of information that can be stored and shared anywhere and everywhere.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h4>2. What are the functional differences between the front-end of a web application and its back-end?</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Front-end web application refers to all the information that is available for users to see or interact
				with
				oposed to back-end web application refers to the more technical side of web developement that users
				don't
				see or have access to, only web developers have acces to this kind of information and are able to edit
				and
				solve problems where neccesary.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h4>3. In your own words, explain the process that takes place from when you type a URL into the address bar in
			your
			browser until you finally view the page you have requested:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Step 1:</b>
				The user enters a domain name in the search bar in the form of a URL(universal resource
				link).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Step 2:</b>
				The browser then uses the link's information as a pathway to find it's location in the world
				wide web, using the internet which allows all the information shared around the world to flow freely
				from
				one device to another.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Step 3:</b>
				The browser luckily aids as a translator, translating all the code information as a graphic
				appearance or in a way that users are able to understand.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Step 4:</b>
				Once the information's location is traced and retrieved, it translates all the code
				information. This allows the user to view or interact with the front-end web page information.
			</li>
		</ul>
